### About Brie
Brie is a discord bot made as a fun & easy to use bot. She has a easy to use command handler that automatically puts the commands into the `br!help` menu. Hopefully this project will expand further as i'm trying to improve it daily by adding new features, changing stuff for easier use & so on. If you wish to support any of my projects i'd be very appreciated. Here's a link to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/etcroot" target="_blank">Patreon</a>, It helps me get motivation to keep developing my projects further & not to mention the server costs to keep Brie running 24/7 with a steady server.
